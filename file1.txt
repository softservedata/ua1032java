I have substantial experience in customer support, primarily with German-speaking clients.
I am an emerging tech professional based in Ukraine, where I am honing my skills
as a Java developer. Recently, I successfully completed the HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript Fundamentals course at the SoftServe Academy.
There, I had the opportunity to serve as a team lead on a website project for a restaurant.
This project provided me with invaluable experience in teamwork and problem-solving.
Currently, I am learning Java Fundamentals and I'm thrilled about
the new opportunities for learning and skill development.
