Create an abstract Person class with fullName field of type FullName and age of type int.
In the Person class, create:
 a constructor public Person(FullName fullName, int age) ;
info() method, which will return a string in the format
"First name: <firstName>, Last name: <lastName>, Age: <age>"
an abstract public activity() method with a String return type.
