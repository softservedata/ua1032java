2. Create a Student class with an int field that matches the course the student is taking.
In the Student class:
create a constructor with parameters to initialize all fields in the class;
override the info() method (which would also add course information to the previous line);
override the activity() method from the Person class. The activity() method should return a string value that is the type of activity for the corresponding Person subtype, for example for a student - this could be the value "I study at university".
In the main() method, create two instances of the Student class and output information about them by calling the appropriate methods info() and activity().
Create one more instance of Student class by cloning the first student, change a course for this object and output full information about  created students.
