A programmer is someone who writes/creates computer software or applications generally by providing
instructions (commonly through the use of a specific programming language) to the computer or by

extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms,
such as Structured Query Language (SQL), Perl, Extensible Markup Language (XML), PHP, HTML, C, C++
