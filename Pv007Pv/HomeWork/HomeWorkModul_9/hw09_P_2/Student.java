 * 2. Create a class called Student which includes the following fields: name, group, course, and
 grades in different subjects. Create a collection that holds all objects. Write a methods that:
 o removes students with a grade point average of less than 3. If a student's average score is
 3 or higher, then they will be automatically promoted to the next course level.
 o printStudents(List<Student> students, int course) which takes a list of students and a
 course number as inputs. This method should print out the names of the students who
 are enrolled in the specified course number to the console.
 â€¢ In main() method create collection and output result.
