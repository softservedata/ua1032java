"Bank" is a software project that simulates a system for managing bank accounts and clients.
The project consists of various classes that interact with each other to ensure the functionality of the banking system.
The main goal of the project is to demonstrate work with object-oriented programming and basic concepts of bank account management.

1. Enum AccountType: This enum type defines two possible bank account types: "Savings" and "Loan".
It contains constants for both account types and has a method to get the name of the account type.

2. Abstract Class BankAccount: This abstract class defines common attributes and methods for bank accounts.
It has private fields for account number, owner and account balance. The constructor sets the initial values of these attributes.
This class also defines the processTransaction and withdrawCash abstract methods that descendants must implement.
This class is used to create a basic structure for different types of accounts.

3. Class BankingApp: This is the main class of the application, which contains the main method.
In the main method, customers and accounts are created, various operations on accounts are performed, and customers are sorted by balance.
This class demonstrates the interaction between classes and the use of their methods to manage bank accounts and customers.

4. Class CreditAccount: This class represents a credit account with a bank.
It inherits properties and methods from the BankAccount base class. The class has fields for the account's opening balance and account type.
The constructor sets the initial values, and the processTransaction and withdrawCash methods are overridden to handle credit account transactions accordingly.

5. Class Customer: This class represents the customer of the bank.
It contains the customer's name and address, as well as a list of accounts belonging to that customer.
This class has methods to get and set the name and address of a customer, and methods to manage a list of accounts.

6. Class SavingsAccount: This class inherits properties and methods from the base class BankAccount and represents a savings account (debit account) without the ability to withdraw cash.
The class has a field for the account type, and the processTransaction and withdrawCash methods are overridden to process transactions and prevent cash withdrawals from the savings account.

In general, the project creates a hierarchy of classes to model and interact with different types of bank accounts.
Each class has a defined role in the system and is responsible for a specific aspect of banking operations.
