I am 18. I am a second year student at Lviv National University at the faculty of Computer Science. I am currently studying a programming Java Fundamentals course at SoftServe University that I really adore.I have already finished HTML & CSS & JS course and I am going to attend all parts of the Java Developer course. Also I am actively studying and improving my English skills, therefore, I suppose my level is B2 now.
